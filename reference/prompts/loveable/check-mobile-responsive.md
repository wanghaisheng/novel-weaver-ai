Our app needs to be **fully responsive** across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

- Follow a **mobile-first** strategy: prioritize the layout for small screens, then adjust for larger screens.
- Use modern UI/UX best practices for responsive design. (For Tailwind CSS, use the standard breakpoints `sm, md, lg, xl` â€“ no custom breakpoints unless necessary.)
- Ensure every page (especially the dashboard and project detail pages) reflows properly on a small screen: elements should stack or resize as needed, text should remain readable, and no content should overflow off-screen.
- **Do not change the core design or functionality**, just make sure it flexibly adapts to different screen sizes.

After making changes, please double-check the layout at iPhone 12 dimensions and a typical desktop width.
