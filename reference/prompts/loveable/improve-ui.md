The app UI should be improved, **without changing any functionality**. 

- Keep all existing logic and state management as is.
- **Visual Enhancements:** Update the styling of the dashboard page: use a modern card design for each project listing, improve the color scheme for better contrast, and increase padding for a cleaner layout.
- Ensure these changes do **not break any functionality or data flow**.

*Goal:* purely cosmetic improvements for a more polished look, with the app behaving exactly as before.
