Refactor the **ProjectList component file**, but **keep its behavior and UI exactly the same**. 

Goals:
- Improve the code structure and readability (simplify complex functions, break into smaller ones if needed).
- Remove any unused variables or imports.
- Ensure the file follows best practices and is well-documented.

Do **not** introduce any new features or change how the component works for the user â€“ this is purely a code cleanup for maintainability. If any part of the code is unclear, add a brief comment for clarification.
